# r2f-study

This project is a study project to learn React Three Fiber

This project use Next14 and React18, because React Three fiber is not officially supported in Next15 and React19, althouh this issue can be resolved by using the rc (release candidate); Leva a library to create GUIs for React Three Fiber is also used in this project, which refuses to work with React19.

## Getting Started
